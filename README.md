# ScIRGen-Geo Dataset

## Overview

The **ScIRGen-Geo Dataset** is a large-scale, task-oriented dataset designed for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in scientific research, with a focus on the geoscience domain. The corpus is fully bilingual (English ↔ Chinese), offering parallel content in both languages. 

This dataset is introduced in the paper **"[ScIRGen: Synthesize Realistic and Large-Scale RAG Dataset for Scientific Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11117)"**, which has been accepted by the KDD conference. The dataset is crafted to reflect real-world research inquiries, incorporating realistic questions, detailed dataset metadata, and relevant paper excerpts.

## Data
We provide the ScIRGen-Geo as HuggingFace `datasets` configurations under [`usail-hkust/ScIRGen-Geo`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/usail-hkust/ScIRGen-Geo). 
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("usail-hkust/ScIRGen-Geo")
```
## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main directories:

- **`full/`**: Contains the complete dataset, including all data entries and supplementary information
- **`train/`**: The training split used for model training
- **`dev/`**: The development (validation) split for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
- **`test/`**: The test split for the final evaluation of models
